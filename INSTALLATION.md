## Troubleshooting

### "Package not found"

Make sure you're using the correct npm package name:
```bash
npm install lightauth
```

Not:
```bash
npm install @mech/auth  # ❌ Old package name (use lightauth)
```

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors, try:

```bash
npm install lightauth --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Corporate Firewall/Proxy

If you're behind a corporate firewall that blocks GitHub:

1. Ask your IT team to whitelist `github.com`
2. Or download the repository and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dundas/mech-auth.git
cd your-project
npm install ../path/to/mech-auth
```

### Argon2 Build Errors

If you get build errors for @node-rs/argon2:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed:
   - **macOS:** `xcode-select --install`
   - **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
   - **Windows:** Install Visual Studio Build Tools

2. Or use pre-built binaries (recommended):
```bash

```
